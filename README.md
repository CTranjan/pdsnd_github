** Description: **
In this project, I make use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. The code imports the data from .csv files and answers questions about it by taking in raw inputs to create an interactive experience in the terminal, in order to compute descriptive statistics.

** Files used: **
- chicago.csv
- new_york_city.csv
- washington.csv
